        <Bubble title="ðŸ’¬ WTF is AI (and whatâ€™s an AI Audit anyway?)">
          <p>Think of an AI Audit as a friendly, plain-English review of how your business runs â€” whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s clunky, and where smarter tools could make life easier.</p>
          <p>Weâ€™ll sit down (or jump on a call) and look at the everyday stuff: your emails, workflows, apps, and the bits that chew up time. Then Iâ€™ll map out where AI might fit â€” safely, simply, and only if it actually helps.</p>
          <p>Youâ€™ll get a clear action plan that shows whatâ€™s worth doing now, what can wait, and whatâ€™s not worth touching.</p>
          <p>No fluff. No tech talk. Just a practical snapshot of how to make your business run smoother â€” thatâ€™s your AI Audit.</p>

        <Bubble title="ðŸ’¬ Freelance Help â€” When You Just Need a Hand">
          <p>Not every job needs a full audit.</p>
          <p>Sometimes you just need a hand setting something up, fixing a workflow, or getting your tech stack talking to each other.</p>
          <p>I take on small freelance projects for local businesses â€” from automating routine tasks to building simple web tools and dashboards.</p>
          <p>Think of it as practical AI support, without the big-agency price tag.</p>

        <Bubble title="ðŸ’¬ Why Work With Me">
          <p>Iâ€™m not here to sell hype or drown you in tech talk â€” Iâ€™m here to help you actually understand whatâ€™s possible for your business.</p>
          <p>Before starting EDV AI Solutions, I worked in planning and operations â€” the kind of roles where getting things done matters more than buzzwords. That background taught me how to spot whatâ€™s practical, whatâ€™s overkill, and how to make change without creating chaos.</p>
          <p>I live on the Mid North Coast, I work with locals, and I care about making AI something small businesses can use â€” not fear.</p>
          <p>If you want a clear, honest chat about where AI might fit into your world (and where it probably shouldnâ€™t), youâ€™ll get that from me. No upsells. No jargon. Just straightforward support to help your business run a little smoother.</p>
