        I’m Glen — the guy behind EDV AI Solutions. I’m not here to drown you in tech talk or promise magic AI fixes. What I do offer is a clear, local way to figure out where AI can actually make your business run smoother — and where it’s simply not worth the hassle.
        <br /><br />
        That process starts with an AI Audit — a friendly, plain-English review of how your business runs day-to-day, what tools you use, and where AI might safely fit in.
        <br /><br />
        I’m a hands-on freelancer based on the Mid North Coast, happy to help however I can — whether that’s explaining the basics, mapping out simple automations, or pointing you in the right direction.
        <br /><br />
        Before launching EDV, I spent years as an ADF medic and healthcare planner, where I learned that good results come down to clear planning, adaptability, and using the right tools for the job. Those lessons carry through to what I do now: helping small businesses make sense of technology, one practical step at a time.
        <br /><br />
        Today, I see myself as a small-business enabler — someone who coaches you through the options, sets up the essentials, and leaves you confident, not dependent. My focus is on plain-English advice, practical AI, and clean web tools that make your life easier, not more complicated.
