        I’m Glen, now living on the Mid North Coast after a career as an ADF medic and in healthcare planning. Those experiences showed me how critical planning, adaptability, and the right tools are to getting the job done. Now I’m a small-business enabler: I coach you through the options, set up the essentials, and leave you confident—not dependent—with plain-English education and advice on practical AI and clean web tools.
